description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 dzcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a p2p network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  this
 requires 20+ gb of space, slowly growing.
 .
 this package provides the daemon, dzcoind, and the cli tool
 dzcoin-cli to interact with the daemon.
